## Chart Versioning Notes

Up until the initial helm chart release for v2.1.0, the helm chart version matched the Rancher version (i.e `appVersion`).

Since there are times where the helm chart will require changes without any changes to the Rancher version, we have moved to a `yyyy.mm.<build-number>` helm chart version.

Run `helm search rancher` to view which Rancher version will be launched for the specific helm chart version.
